            PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
            =====================

struct thread 
  {
    …
#ifdef VM
    struct hash page_table;
    … 
#endif
    …
  }
For each thread (a.k.a. process) you need to keep track of its own page table.

enum location
  {
    SWAP, DISK, NOT_LOADED, FRAME
  };
It helps to retrieve the location of the page table. 

struct page_table_entry
  {
    struct hash_elem hash_elem;
    void *pg_addr;
    enum location l;
    int mapping_index;
    int mapping_fd;
    int mapping_size;
  };
This struct simulates the the supplemental page table explained in the spec.
It holds the necessary data for a page.

As the spec mentions, “every virtual page is aliased to its kernel
virtual page”.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: (5 marks) 
>> When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided? You should consider both when there are
>> and are not free frames available in memory.

When two processes try to access the same frame at the same time 
(Either by a retrieval or removal of a page) we acquire the lock of 
the frame table (defined as a static variable at the top of frame.c) 
right from the beginning and we release it at the end of the function
call. 
In the function where we return the page and map it to the frame
slot (frame_get_page), we first initialise the lock, we obtain
a single free page (from the user pool) and return it to kernel 
virtual address and we insert this new page in the current thread’s
page table and we set the location of this page to be the frame. 
We allocate memory for the frame. If we have space and the
allocation doesn’t fail then we insert it into the frame table. 
In the case where we don’t have enough space for a frame, we have 2 choices:
- If we can’t evict a page and swap is full, then we panic the kernel
- If we can’t evict a page and swap is not full, then we use the swap
space for creating the frame.  

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: (5 marks)
>> Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

We chose to use the hash table for representing virtual-to-physical
mappings due to the fact that we want to retrieve really fast a page 
(In constant time - O(1)) and also have insertion in constant time. Hence,
the only data structure that we could use, which was implemented already 
implemented by Pintos and didn’t overcomplicate the problem was the hash map.

struct frame_table_entry
  {
    struct hash_elem hash_elem;
    void *pg_addr;
  };
Contains the pointer to a page in the hash map and the
starting address of that page. 

struct swap_table_entry
  {
    struct hash_elem hash_elem;
    void *addr;
    block_sector_t sector;
  };
Contains the pointer to a swap slot, the starting address of that
slot and block sector where it is located.

If we require to allocate a frame and we don’t have enough space,
we try to allocate a swap space. If we then decide to evict that 
frame, we reclaim that swap slot.

When we have a page fault, we use is_stack_access () to determine if
the invalid memory access was a stack access. This method checks the
if the address of the fault is within a valid range for stack access,
i.e. within 32 bytes of esp and above 0.
If so, we get upage (user virtual page) and kpage (kernel virtual 
address) values for the new page from the fault address and extend
the stack with this page accordingly.

struct thread

In order to deal with this issue we keep track of what memory is
used by memory mapped files (using file_map defined in thread.h)
, to make sure we handle the page faults in the mapped regions 
the right way and therefore when we add a new file mapping, 
we can easily check if that segment is already occupied or not, 
and proceed accordingly.
