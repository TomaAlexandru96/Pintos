            PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
            =====================

struct thread
  {
    …
#ifdef VM
    struct hash page_table;
    …
#endif
    …
  }

Each process keeps track of its own page table. This design allows us to easily
free all specific pages belonging to a certain process when process exits or in
case of an error.

enum location
  {
    SWAP, DISK, NOT_LOADED, FRAME
  };

Used to keep track of the location of a page weather it is in the physical
memory or in the swap. If there is a page fault, we can set location to swap.
We then check again, if it is not in the swap, because the location now is
SWAP, it means we have an error.

struct page_table_entry
  {
    struct hash_elem hash_elem;
    void *pg_addr;
    enum location l;
    int mapping_index;
    int mapping_fd;
    int mapping_size;
  };
This struct simulates the the supplemental page table explained in the spec.
It holds the necessary data for a page.

If 2 pages alias to a single frame and we try to access it via one of them, 
we only update the accessed and dirty bits of the page that made the access. 
If we share a read only page we won’t have any concurrency issues to deal with, 
hence no need for semaphores or mutual exclusion. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: (5 marks)
>> When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided? You should consider both when there are
>> and are not free frames available in memory.

When two processes try to access the same frame at the same time 
(either by a retrieval or removal of a page) we acquire the lock of 
the frame table (defined as a static variable at the top of frame.c),
and release it at the end of the function call. 
In the function where we return the page and map it to the frame
slot (frame_get_page), we first initialise the lock, obtain
a single free page (from the user pool) and return it to kernel 
virtual address and we insert this new page in the current thread’s
page table and we set the location of this page to be the frame.
We allocate memory for the frame. If we have space and the
allocation doesn’t fail then we insert it into the frame table.
In the case where we don’t have enough space for a frame, we have 2 choices:
- If we can’t evict a page and swap is full, then we panic the kernel
- If we can’t evict a page and swap is not full, then we use the swap
space for creating the frame.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: (5 marks)
>> Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

We chose to use the hash table for representing virtual-to-physical
mappings due to the fact that we want to retrieve pages quickly
(in constant time - O(1)) and also have insertion in constant time. Hence
we chose the only data structure that we could use which was implemented already 
implemented by Pintos and didn’t overcomplicate the problem was the hash map.

               =======================

struct frame_table_entry
  {
    struct hash_elem hash_elem;
    void *pg_addr;
  };

hash_elem is used to implement a hash table. Each entry in the frame table keeps
an address of a user page.

struct swap_table_entry
  {
    struct hash_elem hash_elem;
    void *addr;
    block_sector_t sector;
  };

Used to implement a hash table that keeps mapping from page addresses to
block sector indices. Because the size of a sector is limited to 512B, and a page
has 4KB, we need to use 8 sector to store a page. Therefore the block sector
referred is the first used to store that particular page.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: (5 marks)
>> When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

We implemented random eviction algorithm. We generate a pseudo-random number
using random_ulong (), then we mod this number with the size of the table. This
gives us the index, i, of the entry in the hash table that we want to evict. Then
we iterate through the hash table from the start i times to pick the entry in
the hash table.


>> B3: (5 marks)
>> When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data

Because process q no longer uses that frame, it means that it was evicted in
the swap. When we evict a frame to the swap, we make sure that we add the
address of that frame to the swap table. We than remove the entry from the
page table hash map. Therefore, this means that process P will find that entry
as empty in the page table and can use it.


>> B4: (5 marks)
>> Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

When we have a page fault, we use is_stack_access () to determine if
the invalid memory access was a stack access. This method checks the
if the address of the fault is within a valid range for stack access,
i.e. within 32 bytes of esp and above 0.
If so, we get upage (user virtual page) and kpage (kernel virtual
address) values for the new page from the fault address and extend
the stack with this page accordingly.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: (5 marks)
>> Explain the basics of your VM synchronisation design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to a
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

Our VM memory prevents any deadlock because we ensure mutual exclusion
between all threads (when threads have to access a common place in memory
we introduce a lock), at every point we make sure a thread does not hold
a resource while waiting for another one (this also wastes CPU cycles
unnecessarily) and we avoid cycles by not holding and then waiting for
a resource.

>> B6: (5 marks)
>> A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

In the case when the page fault is caused because the frame is full, and one of
Q's frames is evicted to swap, then we make sure that we call lock_acquire () on
the frame table lock ,ft_lock, when we enter
frame_evict_page (). P has mutual exclusion during the execution of the
function and Q need to wait for ft_lock to be released by P. When the frame was
successfully evicted, when P exits frame_evict_page () function, it calls
lock_release () on ft_lock. Then Q can acquire the ft_lock. There is only one
lock for the frame table, so only one process can do operations such as eviction.
On the other side, we haven't implemented page sharing successfully, therefore
there is no lock for ensuring mutex on writing to pages.
If we were going to do it, we would require Q acquire the ft_lock also when it
needs to write to the page.

// TODO
>> B7: (5 marks)
>> Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls. How do you gracefully handle attempted
>> accesses to invalid virtual addresses?

If we try to access an invalid virtual address which belonged to
a paged-out page, then we just bring that page back. If we access
an invalid virtual address, then we push the exit error code to
the stack, push the syscall_exit to the stack and call the
interrupt handler passing the interrupt frame as parameter.

We consider that we’ve used the right amount of locks in order to
have the best tradeoff between parallelism and synchronisation. We
introduce a lock if and only if 2 processes need to access a common
resource or a shared memory address, unlock it immediately after they
finish using it, keeping the rest of code free for parallelism between
threads.

In order to deal with this issue we keep track of what memory is
used by memory mapped files (using file_map defined in thread.h)
, to make sure we handle the page faults in the mapped regions
the right way and therefore when we add a new file mapping,
we can easily check if that segment is already occupied or not,
and proceed accordingly.
